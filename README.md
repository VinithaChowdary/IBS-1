The project "CFTR Mutation Detection: A Bioinformatic Approach" aims to diagnose cystic fibrosis mutations within the CFTR gene using computational methods. The implementation, developed in Python with the Biopython library, processes protein sequences from a specified FASTA file obtained from NCBI. The system scans the input sequence against a curated list of CFTR mutations associated with cystic fibrosis, identifying and reporting any detected mutations. This project underscores the importance of accuracy and reliability in mutation detection, contributing significantly to the field of computational biology and genetic disorder diagnosis. By integrating advanced technologies and methodologies, this research highlights the potential of bioinformatics in advancing medical research and diagnostic capabilities, providing a robust solution for detecting cystic fibrosis mutations.

Cystic fibrosis is a genetic disorder caused by mutations in the CFTR gene, leading to severe respiratory, digestive, and reproductive system complications. The project emphasizes the need for precise and early detection of specific CFTR mutations to improve diagnostic accuracy and patient outcomes. Utilizing a comprehensive bioinformatic approach, the project reads the protein sequence, identifies mutations by comparing them with the CFTR2 database, and provides a diagnostic message based on the detected mutations. The methodology involves importing essential libraries, defining CFTR mutations, and employing functions to check for these mutations within a given protein sequence. The project's success in accurately identifying known CFTR mutations demonstrates its potential as a diagnostic tool and lays the groundwork for future enhancements, including integrating clinical data and machine learning models for predictive analytics.
